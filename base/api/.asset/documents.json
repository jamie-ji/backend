The program involves assigning each team a service-client based project, and our team was assigned to work with the start-up company Penwell to develop a tool that can analyse literacy assessment of high school students in Australia to generate useful feedback including error types trending by time or by document genre, providing high school teachers and students with more information about diagnosing habitual writing errors using a representative sample of student work. \n\nOur client provided us with a semi-functional prototype which was designed with Python, using Django-React framework. \n\nAfter analysing the project requirements and our team composition, our team determined that the goals are infeasible and not detailed enough for us to proceed. Therefore, we proposed to re-define the project goals and requirements with our client. Our client agreed with our proposal and the finalized project goals are as follows: \n1. Expand upload functionality \n2. Properly identifying metadata \n3. Research ML/NN approaches in Document classification \n4. Document classification with GPT \n5. Experiment with other error checking packages or API \n\nAs the project manager, I was responsible for the following tasks: \n1. Organising team meetings and communicating with the client\n2. Managing the project timeline and deliverables\n3. Managing the team\u2019s GitHub repository and OneDrive repository\n4. Complete two goals of the project (2 and 5)\n5. Review all codework and documentation \n\nFor project management, I decided to use Trello as the management platform. It enables us the capability to keep track on the project in real time and to assign tasks to each team member. \n\n\nBy upholding a high standard of professionalism, the communication with the client was smooth and effective and so does the communication within the team. We have two regular team meetings per week, one internally and one with the client. The internal meeting is used to discuss the progress of the project and to assign tasks to each team member. The meeting with the client is used to discuss the progress of the project and to receive feedback from the client. All meetings are recorded and archived in the OneDrive repository for future reference. \n\nIn the middle section of the development period, our team met the difficulty that some members were not able to finish their assigned task on time. Our tutor suggested that it can be caused by lack of robustness of our Statement of Work, since the SoW was not as detailed as expected, members can lose focus and direction. This also leaves our team vulnerable in the commercial environment. Therefore, I decided to update the SoW, making it more detailed and robust and re-negotiate the terms with our client. I also conducted 1 on 1 meetings with each team member to discuss their progress and helping them to produce more detailed development plans. This experience from mistake can be used as a lesson for future projects and work environment.\n\nThe project is in the final stage was able to produce a .html file containing the analysis of the student's work, including the error types trending by time. The project also has a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload their documents and view the analysis results. \n\n\nAt the end of the semester, our team successfully delivered the project and received positive feedback from the client. The client was satisfied with the project outcome and the team\u2019s performance. \n\n\n", "filename": "Supporting Evidence.docx", "author": "Peicheng Liu", "created_at": "2023-05-24T18:59:00+10:00", "last_modified": "2023-05-24T21:02:00+10:00", "word_count": "594", "category": null, "analysis_complete": true, "user": 1}, {"id": 25, "file": "/documents/user_1/Copy_of_BIPI_SOW_V3.docx", "uploaded_at": "2023-08-26T22:48:45.400175+10:00", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Work\nBIPI Application Development\nBuildItPayIt (BIPI) Pty Ltd\n&\nAustralian National University\n\n\n\nStatement of Work brief details\nStatement of Work number: 004\nThis Statement of Work expires if not executed by both parties by: 31 August 2022\nGeneral\nThe Statement of Work lists the services and activities required by BuildItPayIt (BIPI) Pty Ltd (the Client) from the Australian National University (the Supplier) under the \u2018TechLauncher\u2019 subject course. \nOrganisation\nPROJECT NAME\t\t\tBIPI\t\nCLIENT\t\t\t\tBUILDITPAYIT (BIPI) PTY LTD\nSOW VERSION NUMBER\t\t0.0.2\t\nCLIENT POINT OF CONTACT\tMS FLORINA UHRLE\t\nPHONE\t\t\t\t0407730923\t\nEMAIL\t\t\t\t\thelloadmin@bipi.com.au\t\nMAILING ADDRESS\t\t\t4 Denali Circuit, Warner, QLD 4500\t\nDATE PREPARED\t\t\t08/08/2022\t\nAUTHOR:  \t\t\t\tFlorina Uhrle\nPROJECT MANAGER\t\tFlorina Uhrle\t\nBEGIN DATE\t\t\t\t29/7/2022\nEND DATE\t\t\t\t01/12/2022\nPROJECT DURATION\t\t5 months\nProject Team\nNAME / TITLE\t\t\tCONTACT INFORMATION\t\nYICHENG LU                         U7347659@ANU.EDU.AU\nCHUANWEI FU      \t        \tU7235955@ANU.EDU.AU\nPEILIN SONG         \t        \tLAMBERTK265@GMAIL.COM\nQIURUI XU             \t        \tU7346923@ANU.EDU.AU\nSIHAN LIN (CHALKIE)        \tU6569267@ANU.EDU.AU\nTONG ZOU             \t        \tU7371800@ANU.EDU.AU\nYEWEI DU              \t        \tU7343724@ANU.EDU.AU\nYI XU                       \t        \tXY843409940@GMAIL.COM\nZIHAN MENG         \t        \tMAJIAMENGZIHAN@GMAIL.COM\nProject\nAPPLICATION LOOK AND FEEL, REVISING EXISTING SCHEMA\nStudents will be required to review a pre-existing prototype in both mobile and desktop user interfaces to update to the new design and logo. The team has been split into two teams \u2013 A which will focus primarily on the front end changes and the coding in order to ensure the new designs and logo are functioning links as well as ensuring that the look and feel of the website and applications have a professional look and feel. \nThe front end team (Team A) will need to work closely with the back end (Team B) to ensure that the links work, and that all data entered into the system is stored in a secure relational database system. \nRELATIONAL DATABASE AND BLOCKCHAIN SETUP\nTeam B will work primarily on ensuring that the back end database has the capability and capacity to hold up to half a million separate entries which could grow even further. Each entry will need to have the highest security and the team may need to work with a third party to work on ensuring Blockchain capabilities are included within the back end to ensure the privacy and security of personal information is of the highest standard. The backend team will need to create a relational database schema that will ensure that there is a master key (unique ID) for each new \u2018company\u2019 entered into the system. This will then form the framework for the Blockchain team (outsourced capability) to ensure unique master keys are created. \nThe project at this stage is a mix of revising and revamping the old first MVP to a new look and feel while also ensuring NEW capabilities with the relational database system in the back end as well as ensuring that the \u2018app\u2019 itself will have a professional look and feel when it comes time to upload them to the Android and Apple stores for download. \nPROJECT MANAGEMENT & STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT\nThere is also an element of project management and stakeholder engagement as the students will also have to explain the work that they have completed as examples to stakeholders when we hold meetings with major clients. Our most senior client at this stage is the QLD State Housing Minister, Ms Leanne Enoch as well as MBA Australia CEO. \nThe project team will also need to understand the purpose of the app\u2019s design as a whole concept in order to explain to Angel Investors as well as Venture Capitalists. The students will be learning the value of an app and how to pitch the idea in innovation networks. \nBackground\nThis app was created to ensure security of payment, and that was to allow instantaneous payments from the Borrowers to the trades directly, by removing the onus of responsibility from the Banks to the Borrowers, and de-risking the build process by removing the onus of risk from the Builders to each of the trades who would be owning their own risk. This would also incentivise trades to get their jobs done quickly and effectively, as the Builders would ONLY need to sign off on the work, before the trade can send an invoice through the app to the Builder to approve, which would then kick off a workflow for the invoice to go directly to the Borrowers to then approve the payment. \nThis was just the start of the changes to the building industry. This app is not just an \u2018app\u2019, its a complete change of concept in how the building and construction industry would work. It will have the capability to regulate the Builders (or any new Business Owner within the Building and Construction Industry (BCI) who request a building license. All trades and builders would only have access to the \u2018app\u2019 after having gone through a certain learning module from a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) that would go through property fiscal responsibility (components from the Banks) and building audit requirements, set by both the National Construction Code (NCC) and each State\u2019s own Building and Construction regulations and policies. Only after the Builder or Tradesperson has passed this learning module, would they then receive access to the app thereby ensuring that they are compliant with both NCC and their States\u2019 building and construction codes but also by the national Banking audit and regulatory fiscal requirements as well as also being \u2018credit checked\u2019 at the Director level once they have applied for a building license and business name. \nThis process which comes along with the \u2018app\u2019 ensures that the country will have a solid foundation of reputable builders, who are knowledgeable within their rights and regulations of the NCC and local State building and construction codes as well as understanding what they need to have in place for proper fiscal management. This \u2018app\u2019 and concept grows beyond just the basic training for proper building codes and fiscal management, it will later on down the track also include blockchain view of source materials for all building projects in Australia to ensure insurance compliance and it will ensure that all certifications for the build including all certifications to achieve a Certificate of Occupancy, will be kept with the house files within the app database.  \nThis round of TechLauncher will require the students to recreate new and fresh looking marketable website and app designs as well as create relational database schema in the background to ensure that the amount of data that will be entered into the database from existing tradespersons will be managed. \nResource Requirements\nA team of ANU (Australian National University) students to review, design, build, execute and produce a minimum marketable viable product (MMVP) for the presentation to clients and potential future customers.\nExternally there will also be a Blockchain team to work with the students working on the relational databases to interconnect Blockchain systems into the build. \nThere will also be externally contact with stakeholders of an executive level to pitch for angel or venture capitalist investment as well as also negotiating with Banks and Builders. \nProject Schedule (high level)\nScope of Work\nStudents will need to review the MVP and design the user interface to ensure a more professional participant experience. Students may design the back end platform to support the user interface and can (if experience is present) work in alignment with third party Blockchain professionals to ensure privacy and security of information. Students will also need to represent the company at networking events, while working in the co-working space within CBRIN as well as potentially pitch the solution to potential investors and stakeholders at the CBRIN First Wednesday Connect. Students will also be exposed to industry through meetings with potential investors of the app and the Client. \nProject Deliverables\nThree UI/UX wireframes for the new website \nThree UI/UX wireframes for the new mobile apps\nProduce a framework for the backend relational database for all incoming information\nFind out costing and best value for money for database hosting\nProvide cost figures for hosting on Apple and Android Stores\nProduce Sprint Ceremony documentation each sprint (per 1 or 2 weeks to be decided by the team)\nProduce Risk Management Plan for the scenario of hacking and loss of data/privacy of client data\nFind best value for money for privacy and protection of the servers\nResearch and find best value for money for the purchase of servers\nProduce a hardware network set up to mirror that of the website and mobile app data ingress\nTeam to pitch at CBRIN First Wednesday Connect and then stay to network, find two contacts per person\nTeam to work with partner team to line up API inputs to ensure the right framework and inputs are requested from both parties\nTeam to work with third party businesses to ensure that API requirements are met in order to sufficiently \u2018credit check\u2019 any new business director that has applied to open a new business\nMilestones\nDeliverable Materials\nThose set out within the Milestones as well as (at minimum) a functioning front user interface for both mobile and website application with a functioning back end platform to support it.

At the initial stage of this current project, I allocated each team member way more workload than expected, since I believed that would be the way to deliver a well-established and well-developed project. And I still believe that is the case. Yet our examiner pointed out in the first Audit that I need to think about what this type of workload would affect our morale, and what my teammates, although not expressed out loud, might react. Now, the SoW is being revised and hopefully I can drop the workload to a more reasonable level. \n\nThis is my second Techlauncher semester, from previous experience, I have been trying to prioritise effective communication by expressing my ideas clearly and succinctly, even if it takes extra effort. And this is working spectacularly well, it reduces miscommunication by a lot and our team is getting into the project way earlier and easier than previous semester despite the fact that we have more new members than continuous members.
